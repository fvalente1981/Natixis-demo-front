Backend URL Configuration

To connect the frontend with the backend API, you need to update the API URL in the environment file.

Open:

src/environments/environment.ts


Locate the property:

apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/api/'


Change the value to the URL where your backend is running.
For example:

apiUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/'
```

```
